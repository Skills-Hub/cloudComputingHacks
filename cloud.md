### Cloud computing terms 

1. **Cloud Computing (What)**: Imagine your house isn't just a structure but a dynamic space where furniture and belongings can appear, shift, or disappear based on your needs. You don't own these items; instead, you access what you need when you need it.

2. **Service Provider (Who)**: This is like a property management company that maintains your dynamic house, ensuring that furniture and other items are available to you upon demand.

3. **Data Centers (Where)**: These are the warehouses where your furniture and belongings are stored when not in use, ready to be summoned to your house (or your neighbor's house) as needed.
